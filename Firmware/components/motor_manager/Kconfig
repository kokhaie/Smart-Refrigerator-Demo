        help
            Select the GPIO pin connected to the fan motor driver.

    config FAN_LEDC_FREQUENCY

        help
            Set the PWM frequency for the fan controller.
            A value around 5000 Hz is typical to avoid audible noise.

    config VIBRATION_PIN
        int "Vibration Motor GPIO Pin"
        default 48
        help
            Select the GPIO pin connected to the vibration motor driver.

    config VIBRATION_LEDC_FREQUENCY
        int "Vibration Motor PWM Frequency (Hz)"
        default 250
        help
            Set the PWM frequency for the vibration motor. Lower frequencies can
            sometimes provide a stronger haptic effect for certain motor types.
